# lurror.lua

[lurror.lua](lurror.lua) is a module that adds structured exceptions to Lua. Exceptions, like coroutines are not used very frequently in Lua because they solve cross-cutting concerns(*) that don't appear very often in code. But when they do appear, these devices are invaluable code decluttering tools.

Structured exceptions are an enhancement over string exceptions that enable _selective catching_ and allow _providing a context_ for the failure to help with recovery or logging.

> (*) Coroutines address the problem of inversion-of-control head-on.\
> Exceptions address the problem of recoverable failure head-on, so they're most useful in network I/O contexts.

The name Lurror comes from the amalgamation of the two phonetic sounds of the two words _"Lua"_ and _"Error"_; Combined together to create **Lurror**!

### NOTE!

**In the API `classes` can be given as `'classname1 ...'` or `{class1 -> true}`. When in table form, you must include all the superclasses in the table as they are not added automatically!**
